# misc
Just random stuff, scripts, and utils.

decorators.py
-------------
Some decorator functions. Some of those are pretty useful stuff, e.g. for
memoization, or trace output, or type-checking, or making any function a var-
args function, or for re-trying some function until it works.

automata/
---------
Different generic automata (elementary automata, cellular automata, etc.) and
fractal generators. Fun to play around with, but really just that.
